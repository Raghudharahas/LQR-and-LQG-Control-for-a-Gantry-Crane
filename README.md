# LQR-and-LQG-Control-for-a-Gantry-Crane
This project focuses on the control and observer design for a gantry crane system consisting of a frictionless cart with two suspended loads. The system is modeled nonlinearly and linearized around an equilibrium point, followed by the design of an LQR controller and Luenberger observers. The controllability and observability of the linearized system are analyzed, and simulation results are presented for both the linearized and nonlinear systems. Additionally, an output feedback controller using the LQG method is designed and evaluated for tracking and disturbance rejection. The project provides insights into the stability and performance of the closed-loop system, showcasing the application of control theory in the field of gantry crane dynamics.
